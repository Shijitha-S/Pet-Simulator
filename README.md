The project focus on Virtual Pet simulator in which our task is to build a C# code to design a virtual simulator for the pet. User can choose 3 types of pet Dog, Cat or Rabbit.
The Project starts with proving the name for the pet and displaying the welcome message for the pet with the name and the type of pet chosen.
User can then implement some actions to the pet such as feeding the pet, playing with the pet, letting the pet to rest. These actions will let the user know about whether the Pet is Hungry, Happy or healthy.
Each of these 3 actions gives more insight on the behavior of the pet as below:
**Feeding**: Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
**Playing**: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
**Resting**: Improves health, decreases happiness slightly
The application also allows the user to monitor the status of the pet and provide action based on the status. These status are displayed in the scale of 1 to 10 
Also, the application gives more enhanced feature on when the pet's health is getting deteriorated and warns the user when the status is critically low/high.
This application provides simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.

**Set up instruction:**
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project as "Pet_Simulator" in C#.
2. Build or write the code as per instruction and run the project
3. Run the code and verify each actions for the chosen pet to validate if the project is working as expected.
4. Once we analyze the application, enter 5 to exit from console terminal and save the code.
5. Finally push the code to GitHub to create a Github repository.
